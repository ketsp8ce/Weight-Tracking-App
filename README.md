# Weight-Tracking-App

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This application is a simple way for users to track their wait while on earth for the purpose of either a weight loss or weight gain plan.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application uses a login screen, and a table management screen. The login screen takes fields such as username and password and the database table management screen allows the user to modify the table with weight entries. When the user reaches their goal weight the app congratulates them. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used a combination of the android studio interface, java coding, and xml coding. xml was a useful language to learn because it is a widely applied markup languge. Some of the java skills used much more backend concepts then I had used before such as a handler. Much of what I learned during this project such as backend coding is widely applicable to future endeavers. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I did a lot of dynamic testing of each view and each application fuction from each view. I was unable to visually deploy the correct views in some cases such as the SMS alert message. This was a good oppurtunity to practicing applying code to a project in real time. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During all of the unfamiliar backend protocols.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
In the xml portion which was designing the UI.
